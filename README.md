This is the assignment of B.Tech 4th sem operating systems course.

### Question:
Create a Process Id (PID) manager that keeps track of free PIDs and ensures that no two active processes are having the same pid. Once a process terminates the PID manager may assigns its pid to new process. Use the following constants to identify the range of possible pid values: `#define MIN PID 100 #define MAX PID 1000`
